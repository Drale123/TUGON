                An earthquake is a sudden, rapid shaking of the earth caused by the shifting of underground rock. Deaths and injuries occur when people fall trying to walk
                 or run during shaking or when they are hit by falling debris. Smaller earthquakes, called aftershocks,
                  always follow the mainshock. Earthquakes can cause tsunamis, landslides, fires, and damage to utilities.
                   Earthquakes can happen anywhere, and there is no way to predict them. But we can take action to prepare. 
                   Prepare now to protect yourself, your loved ones, and your home.
